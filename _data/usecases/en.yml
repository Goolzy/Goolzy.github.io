          **Problem**: With a busy schedule, I often forget about expiration dates and end up throwing away spoiled food. Especially things like tofu and milk go bad within days...

          **Solution**: I created items for each ingredient using [Paper](/inventory/manual/en/#paper) and set [Expiry Dates](/inventory/manual/en/#dates). Now I get notifications 3 days before expiration, so I can cook or freeze items in time.

          My 18-month-old said "Mama" for the first time. My heart felt like it would burst.

          I recorded the moment on video, but that wasn't enough. I wanted to remember the emotions, the context, what happened the day before...

          In Inventory, I saved the video with a [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log) entry capturing every detail of that day. When daddy came home and he said "Mama" again, how I cried that evening...

          Five years later, when my son started elementary school, I read these records again. The emotions came flooding back. Inventory became our family's time capsule.

        content: |
          After my mother-in-law got ill, I worried about the family recipes passed down for generations. When I asked "How do you make this broth?", she'd just say "about this much"...

          I sat beside her, filmed her cooking, and transcribed everything exactly as she said into [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). "Three finger-widths of red pepper flakes", "add soy sauce little by little"...

          After she passed, I read these records whenever preparing family meals. I can almost hear her voice. Now I'll pass this Inventory to my daughter-in-law.

          Three years together. The cafe where we first held hands, the park where we first kissed, the restaurant where he proposed... we have our special places, but worried they'd be forgotten with time.

          Created 'Our Places' in Inventory with [Shared Log](/inventory/manual/en/#-shared-log-vs-solo-log) mode. After each date, we add photos and record our conversations and feelings. Documenting together doubles the memories.

          We're including these records in our wedding video. Years from now, we'll still remember how we began.

          My 9-year-old dog 'Buddy' and I have been together for years. Knowing time is limited makes each day precious.

          Every day, I post Buddy's photos in Inventory. What he ate, what we saw on walks, his expression before sleep. I write it like a diary in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log).

          A friend asked "Why do you do this every day?" I replied: "When Buddy is gone, I want to remember how happy he was." It's sad, but these records will bring comfort later.

          While organizing my father's study, I found photos from the 1970s. Faded and creased, but capturing my young father.

          I scanned them digitally and registered in Inventory. For each photo, I asked my father and recorded his stories in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). "This was the suit from my first paycheck", "This was our honeymoon in the countryside"...

          For his 60th birthday, I made a video from these records. He cried. "When did you ask all these questions?" It was the most meaningful gift.

        content: |
          Job hunting. Every rejection crushed my confidence.

          Created a 'Growth Journal' in Inventory. Recording every small achievement. "30 minutes of English conversation today", "Updated portfolio with feedback", "Interviewer liked my introduction"...

          After 3 months, the records piled up. On rejection days, I read past entries and gain strength. "I've grown this much." When I finally got the offer, I wrote "Accepted!" in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). That entry shines the brightest.

          Music has the power to bring back memories. Certain songs transport me to specific moments.

          Created 'Life OST' in Inventory. For meaningful moments, I register the song playing and record the moment in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). The song on my first day at work, the song that comforted me after a breakup...

          On hard days, I play this playlist while reading the stories attached to each song. My life's soundtrack keeps growing richer.

        content: |
          I still have letters from my first class 10 years ago. Children's crooked handwriting saying "I love you teacher". The paper is aging and it breaks my heart.

          I photographed each letter and uploaded to Inventory. In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), I wrote memories of each child. "This one was shy at first but became the most active", "Got this letter on graduation day"...

          On difficult days, I open these records. The children's love comes through and gives me strength. This is why I teach.

          20 weeks pregnant. Every day brings something new as my belly grows. First kicks, first ultrasound, baby name candidates...

          Created 'Waiting for Baby' journal in Inventory. Each prenatal visit, I upload ultrasound photos and record my emotions in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). "Cried when I heard the heartbeat today", "Baby started kicking! Husband felt it too"...

          I dream of publishing a novel someday. Still unknown, but writing a little every day.

          Created 'Writer's Journey' in Inventory. When inspiration strikes, I register with [Paper](/inventory/manual/en/#paper) and keep a writing journal in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). "Wrote 3 pages today", "Decided on character name", "Changed the ending"...

          When my book is published, I want to share these records. "Here's the journey to that first sentence."

          Living alone, days just pass by. Nothing special, no one to remember.

          Started recording daily life in Inventory. Today's cooking, the sunset from my window, a movie watched alone... Small things go in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log).

          A year later, I realized: my daily life is meaningful too. I'm alone but not lonely, because I'm recording myself.

          Lost a friend suddenly 2 years ago. Feared memories would fade with time.

          Gathered all memories with my friend in Inventory. Photos together, chat screenshots, handwritten notes... In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), I wrote about moments together. "This photo from graduation trip", "This was when friend bought lunch with first paycheck"...

          On anniversaries, I open these records. I think friend would say "Thanks for remembering me like this." Memories don't fade if you record them.

          Redevelopment started and 30-year-old shops are closing one by one. The diner lady, the stationery shop owner, the laundry lady...

          Started recording them in Inventory before they disappear. Shop photos, owner interviews, recommended items... In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), my own memories with each place.

          When I showed neighbors, they cried. "Thank you for keeping this." Inventory became our neighborhood's history.

          My child asks "Why?" constantly. "Why is the sky blue?", "Why do dogs bark?", "Why does mommy work?"

          I register each question in Inventory and record my answers in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). When the same question comes up later, I show the old entry: "Remember what mommy said?"

          My child is amazed. "Wow, I asked that?" A history of curiosity is building. What will they feel reading this when they're older?

          Started learning to cook but everything failed at first. Burnt, too salty, too tough...

          I thought about only posting successes, but decided to upload failures too. In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), I analyzed "why it failed."

          Three months later, I compared my first disaster curry with today's curry. Night and day difference! The failure records are actually the most satisfying. "Look how much I've grown."

          After experiencing depression, I was advised to keep a gratitude journal. At first, I felt I had nothing to write.

          Created 'Today's Gratitude' in Inventory. Every night, I write at least three things, however small. "Weather was nice today", "Coffee was delicious", "Bus came right away"...

          A year later, 365 gratitudes accumulated. On hard days, reading these reminds me the world isn't so bad.

          Working in the city, can't visit my elderly parents in the countryside often. It hurts to see them aging.

          With permission, I record our phone calls and save them in Inventory. In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), I note what we talked about. "Today mom talked about neighborhood flowers", "Dad said take care of my health"...

          When I miss them, I play the recordings. Their voices warm my heart. Knowing these voices will become even more precious someday.

          My child's drawings are piling up. All precious, but paper keeps accumulating.

          I photograph each drawing and upload to Inventory. In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), I record their explanation: "This is daddy. This is a dinosaur." Their imagination captured as-is.

          Years later, we'll see how their drawing evolved, how their imagination changed. Paper can be discarded, but records last forever.

          I was backpacking through Europe. Lost my bag on the Paris metro. Passport, cards, camera... everything was inside.

          Fortunately, I had registered all bag contents in Inventory. At the police station, when asked "What was in the bag?", I searched by [Keywords](/inventory/manual/en/#keyword) and showed a complete list. Even my passport number was recorded.

          Two weeks later, the bag was found! Police said: "The detailed list made verification easy." Inventory was my savior.

          A friend transferred schools in high school. Lost contact after. Sometimes I'd think about them.

          I was organizing memories with that friend in Inventory. In [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log), I recorded "photo in our school uniform", "songs they liked", "the last day we met".

          One day, I shared these records on social media. "Does anyone know this friend?" Amazingly, a friend of their friend reached out. After 10 years, we reunited. Inventory built the bridge.

          After grandfather passed, we sorted through his belongings. There were many old items that I almost threw away without knowing their significance.

          I photographed everything and registered in Inventory, then asked my father about each item, recording in [Log](/inventory/manual/en/#log). "This was grandfather's first watch", "This was used during the war"...

          Then I found an old document. Turns out it was 70-year-old papers related to independence movement recognition! We contacted the government and grandfather's contributions were honored. Would have been buried forever if we'd just thrown it away.
