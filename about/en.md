## We Research Joy.

### Unique play culture is the product of Goolzy.

Goolzy was founded by people who enjoy creating joyful products, with the mission of connecting work and leisure, learning and teaching, consumption and production — all through joy.

Goolzy researches and develops all entertainment content connected to joy. We promise that all Goolzy products, including digital games and toys, will provide unprecedented new experiences.

We have the following core goals:

- **Connection**: We research experiences that don't end with one product but can connect to the next.
- **Value**: We aim for a platform where users' enjoyment leads to meaningful creation.
- **Interface**: We remove outdated and difficult interfaces to make things easy to enjoy.
